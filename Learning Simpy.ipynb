    "1. Resource - Resources that can be used by a limited number of processes at a time (e.g., a gas station with a limited number of fuel pumps).\n",

    "3. Container - Resources that model the production and consumption of a homogeneous, undifferentiated bulk. It may either be continuous (like water) or discrete (like apples).\n",
    "\n",
    "All resources share the same basic concept: The resource itself is some kind of a container with a, usually limited, capacity. Processes can either try to put something into the resource or try to get something out. If the resource is full or empty, they have to queue up and wait.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requesting a resource is modeled as “putting a process’ token into the resource” and releasing a resource correspondingly as “getting a process’ token out of the resource”. Thus, calling `request()`/`release()` is equivalent to calling `put()`/`get()`. Releasing a resource will always succeed immediately."
